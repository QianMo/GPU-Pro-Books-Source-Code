# This project can be compiled by typing 'icompile'
# at the command line. Download the iCompile Python
# script from http://ice.sf.net

################################################################

# If you have special needs, you can edit per-project ice.txt
# files and your global ~/.icompile file to customize the
# way your projects build.  However, the default values are
# probably sufficient and you don't *have* to edit these.
#
# To return to default settings, just delete ice.txt and
# ~/.icompile and iCompile will generate new ones when run.
#
#
# In general you can set values without any quotes, e.g.:
#
#  compileoptions = -O3 -g --verbose $(CXXFLAGS) %(defaultcompileoptions)s
#
# Adds the '-O3' '-g' and '--verbose' options to the defaults as
# well as the value of environment variable CXXFLAGS.
# 
# These files have the following sections and variables.
# Values in ice.txt override those specified in .icompile.
#
# GLOBAL Section
#  compiler           Path to compiler.
#  include            Semi-colon or colon (on Linux) separated
#                     include paths.
#
#  library            Same, for library paths.
#
#  defaultinclude     The initial include path.
#
#  defaultlibrary     The initial library path.
#
#  defaultcompiler    The initial compiler.
#
#  defaultexclude     Regular expression for directories to exclude
#                     when searching for C++ files.  Environment
#                     variables are NOT expanded for this expression.
#                     e.g. exclude: <EXCLUDE>|^win32$
# 
#  builddir           Build directory, relative to ice.txt.  Start with a 
#                     leading slash (/) to make absolute.
#
#  tempdir            Temp directory, relative to ice.txt. Start with a 
#                     leading slash (/) to make absolute.
#
#  beep               If True, beep after compilation
#
#  workdir            Directory to use as the current working directory
#                     (cwd) when launching the compiled program with
#                     the --gdb or --run flag
#
# DEBUG and RELEASE Sections
#
#  compileoptions                     
#  linkoptions        Options *in addition* to the ones iCompile
#                     generates for the compiler and linker, separated
#                     by spaces as if they were on a command line.
#
#
# The following special values are available:
#
#   $(envvar)        Value of shell variable named envvar.
#                    Unset variables are the empty string.
#   $(shell ...)     Runs the '...' and replaces the expression
#                    as if it were the value of an envvar.
#   %(localvar)s     Value of a variable set inside ice.txt
#                    or .icompile (Yes, you need that 's'--
#                    it is a Python thing.)
#   <NEWESTCOMPILER> The newest version of gcc or Visual Studio on your system.
#   <EXCLUDE>        Default directories excluded from compilation.
#
# The special values may differ between the RELEASE and DEBUG
# targets.  The default .icompile sets the 'default' variables
# and the default ice.txt sets the real ones from those, so you
# can chain settings.
#
#  Colors have the form:
#
#    [bold|underline|reverse|italic|blink|fastblink|hidden|strikethrough]
#    [FG] [on BG]
#
#  where FG and BG are each one of
#   {default, black, red, green, brown, blue, purple, cyan, white}
#  Many styles (e.g. blink, italic) are not supported on most terminals.
#
#  Examples of legal colors: "bold", "bold red", "bold red on white", "green",
#  "bold on black"
